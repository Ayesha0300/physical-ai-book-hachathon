# Chapter 3 Exercises: Gazebo Simulation

## Exercise 3.1: Gazebo-ROS2 Integration
**Objective**: Understand the integration between Gazebo and ROS 2

**Instructions**: Explain the communication patterns between Gazebo and ROS 2, including how topics, services, and actions are used to control simulated robots. Describe the role of Gazebo plugins in facilitating this integration and provide examples of common message types used for robot control in simulation.

**Difficulty**: Beginner

**Expected Outcome**: A clear explanation of Gazebo-ROS 2 integration with examples of communication patterns.

## Exercise 3.2: Robot Model Design in Gazebo
**Objective**: Design a simple humanoid robot model for Gazebo

**Instructions**: Outline the URDF or XACRO structure for a simple humanoid robot with at least 4 joints (e.g., hip, knee, shoulder, elbow). Include the necessary Gazebo-specific tags for physics simulation, such as collision properties, inertial properties, and transmission definitions. Explain why each component is important for realistic simulation.

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Expected Outcome**: A well-structured robot model with explanations of Gazebo-specific simulation components.

## Exercise 3.3: Collision and Contact Simulation
**Objective**: Analyze collision detection and contact force modeling in Gazebo

**Instructions**: Describe how Gazebo models collisions and contact forces between objects. Explain the differences between collision geometry and visual geometry, and discuss how contact properties (friction, restitution) affect robot behavior. Create a scenario where accurate contact simulation is critical for robot performance.

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Expected Outcome**: A detailed explanation of collision and contact simulation with a practical scenario.

## Exercise 3.4: Simulation Artifacts Investigation
**Objective**: Identify and address common Gazebo simulation artifacts

**Instructions**: Research and describe at least 3 common simulation artifacts that can occur in Gazebo when simulating humanoid robots (e.g., jittering, unrealistic joint behavior, collision issues). For each artifact, explain what causes it and how to mitigate or prevent it. Create a troubleshooting guide for addressing these issues.

**Difficulty**: Advanced

**Expected Outcome**: A comprehensive guide to identifying and addressing common Gazebo simulation artifacts.
