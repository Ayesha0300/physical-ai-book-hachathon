# Interactive Learning Support

## Overview
The AI-powered chatbot provides interactive learning support throughout your Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics journey. Get instant help with concepts, code, and troubleshooting.

## Features

### Concept Clarification
- Explain complex robotics and AI concepts in simple terms
- Provide examples and analogies
- Connect concepts across different modules

### Code Assistance
- Help with ROS 2 code examples
- Debugging support for robotics applications
- Best practices for robot programming

### Curriculum Navigation
- Suggest next learning steps based on your progress
- Identify prerequisite knowledge for advanced topics
- Recommend relevant modules for your interests

### Troubleshooting
- Help diagnose common issues in simulation and hardware

- Connect you to relevant documentation

## How to Use

### Getting Started
1. Ask about specific concepts: "Explain ROS 2 topics"
2. Request code examples: "Show me a publisher node in Python"
3. Get troubleshooting help: "My robot isn't moving in Gazebo"

### Advanced Queries
- "How does this relate to Module 2 concepts?"
- "What are the prerequisites for understanding Isaac Sim?"
- "Show me the connection between perception and control"

## Integration with Learning Modules

The chatbot understands the entire curriculum structure:
- **Module 1**: ROS 2 architecture and communication
- **Module 2**: Simulation environments and physics
- **Module 3**: NVIDIA Isaac and AI integration
- **Module 4**: Vision-language-action systems
- **Module 5**: Manipulation and locomotion
- **Module 6**: Embodied agents and intelligence

## Best Practices
- Be specific with your questions
- Mention which module you're working on
- Ask for step-by-step explanations
- Request practical examples when available

## Limitations
- For hardware-specific issues, refer to the Hardware section
- Complex system integration requires following module documentation
- Real-time performance questions should reference specific modules
