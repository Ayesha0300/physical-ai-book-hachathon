# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book covers the fundamental concepts of robotics, artificial intelligence, and their integration in humanoid systems.

## About This Book

This educational resource is designed for:
- AI and computer science students new to robotics
- Software engineers transitioning into Physical AI
- Robotics learners preparing for humanoid systems

## Module Overview

This book is organized into several modules, with Module 1 focusing on the foundational concepts:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
- Chapter 1: Why Robots Need a Nervous System
- Chapter 2: ROS 2 Architecture Overview
- Chapter 3: Communication Primitives in ROS 2
- Chapter 4: ROS 2 Nodes in Practice
- Chapter 5: Bridging Python AI Agents with ROS 2 (rclpy)
- Chapter 6: Robot Description with URDF
- Chapter 7: From Digital Brain to Physical Body

## Getting Started

Begin with Chapter 1 to understand why robots require middleware like ROS 2 to coordinate their distributed components, then proceed through each chapter sequentially to build a comprehensive understanding of the robotic nervous system.
