## Technical Content Specific Adaptations

### For Technical Papers with Code
When citing papers that include code repositories:
```
Author, A. A., & Author, B. B. (Year). Title of paper. In Conference Name (pp. page-page). Publisher. Code repository: https://github.com/...
```

### For Dataset Citations

```

### For Preprints and ArXiv Papers
```
Author, A. A., Author, B. B., & Author, C. C. (Year). Title of paper (arXiv:####.##### [cs.###]). arXiv preprint server. URL
```

### For Technical Blog Posts
```
Author, A. A. (Year, Month Day). Title of blog post. Blog Name. URL
```

## In-Text Citation Format

### Parenthetical Citations
- For one author: (Smith, 2023)
- For two authors: (Smith & Johnson, 2023)
- For three or more authors: (Smith et al., 2023)
- For multiple sources: (Smith, 2023; Johnson et al., 2022)

### Narrative Citations
- Smith (2023) showed that...
- As demonstrated by Smith and Johnson (2023)...
- Recent work by Smith et al. (2023) indicates...

## Reference List Format

### Alphabetical Order
- Arrange entries alphabetically by the first author's surname
- If multiple works by the same author, arrange by year (earliest first)
- If same author and year, use lowercase letters (2023a, 2023b)

### Hanging Indent
- First line flush left
- Subsequent lines indented 0.5 inches

### Example Reference List

## Technical Content Verification Requirements

### Authority Verification
- Prioritize peer-reviewed academic sources
- Use official documentation from technology creators
- Verify credentials and expertise of authors
- Cross-reference claims with multiple sources

### Currency Requirements
- **Robotics/AI**: Sources should be within 3-5 years
- **Established theory**: Sources may be older if foundational
- **Software/APIs**: Use most recent documentation
- **Hardware specifications**: Use current or most recent specs

### Accessibility Verification
- All cited URLs must be accessible
- DOI links should resolve properly
- Archived versions should be available for critical sources
- Verify that institutional access requirements are noted if applicable

## Citation Management Best Practices

### For Authors
1. **Cite as you write**: Add citations during the writing process, not afterward
2. **Verify before publishing**: Check all citations for accuracy and accessibility
3. **Use consistent formatting**: Follow the exact format specified above
4. **Distinguish between types**: Clearly differentiate between academic, technical, and commercial sources

### For Reviewers
1. **Check citation accuracy**: Verify that citations match the referenced material
2. **Validate authority**: Ensure sources are authoritative and relevant
3. **Confirm accessibility**: Verify that URLs and DOIs are functional
4. **Assess relevance**: Ensure citations support the claims being made

## Common Citation Scenarios for VLA Content

### When Citing LLM Capabilities
```
When citing LLM capabilities, always reference the specific model version and evaluation methodology:
Brown et al. (2023) demonstrated that GPT-4 achieved 85% accuracy on robotic task planning benchmarks (OpenAI, 2023).
```

### When Citing ROS 2 Components
```
Reference the specific ROS 2 distribution and package:
The navigation2 stack in ROS 2 Humble provides advanced path planning capabilities (Open Robotics, 2023).
```

### When Citing Simulation Platforms
```
Include version information and specific features:
Isaac Sim 2023.1.0 provides photorealistic rendering for robot perception training (NVIDIA, 2023).
```

### When Citing Performance Metrics
```
Always include the experimental setup and conditions:
The VLA system achieved 92% task completion rate in controlled laboratory conditions (Chen et al., 2023).
```

## Quality Assurance Checklist

Before finalizing any VLA module content, verify:

- [ ] All technical claims have supporting citations
- [ ] Citations follow APA 7th edition format with technical adaptations
- [ ] Sources are authoritative and current
- [ ] URLs and DOIs are accessible

## Updates and Maintenance

Citation standards should be reviewed annually and updated as needed to reflect:
- Changes in APA style guidelines
- New types of technical sources
- Feedback from authors and reviewers
- Evolving best practices in technical communication
