# Hardware Setup and Configuration

## Overview
This section provides detailed information about the hardware setup required for the Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics curriculum. The hardware configuration enables students to apply the concepts learned in the modules to physical systems.

## Required Components

### Basic Robot Platform
- **Robotic Platform**: Choose from supported platforms (humanoid, wheeled, or manipulator)
- **Computing Unit**: Single-board computer (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4, NVIDIA Jetson Nano)
- **Sensors**: IMU, cameras, LiDAR, force/torque sensors
- **Actuators**: Servos, DC motors, or stepper motors

### Advanced Configurations
- **Humanoid Robot**: Torso, head, arms, and legs with appropriate actuators
- **Vision System**: Stereo cameras for depth perception
- **Processing Unit**: High-performance computing for real-time AI inference

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Physical Assembly
- Follow the assembly guide for your chosen robot platform
- Verify all connections and mounting points
- Test individual actuators before system integration

### 2. Electronics Configuration
- Connect sensors to appropriate ports on the computing unit
- Verify power distribution and safety measures
- Configure communication protocols (UART, I2C, SPI)

### 3. Software Installation
- Install the robot operating system (matching the ROS 2 module)
- Configure sensor drivers and calibration
- Set up communication with the control system

## Safety Considerations
- Always perform safety checks before powering on the robot
- Maintain clear operational space during testing
- Have emergency stop procedures in place

## Integration with Curriculum
The hardware platform directly connects to the concepts covered in:
- Module 1: ROS 2 communication with hardware
- Module 2: Simulation to reality transfer
- Module 3: AI integration with physical systems
- Module 4: Vision-language-action systems
- Module 5: Manipulation and locomotion
- Module 6: Embodied agents

## Troubleshooting
Common hardware issues and solutions are documented in the troubleshooting section of each relevant module.
