# Chapter 4 Exercises: Environment Building and World Modeling

## Exercise 4.1: Static vs Dynamic Environments
**Objective**: Distinguish between static and dynamic simulation environments

**Instructions**: Define static and dynamic environments in the context of robotics simulation. Provide two examples of each type and explain when you would use each. Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of static vs dynamic environments for testing robot autonomy, and describe the technical differences in how they are implemented in simulation tools.

**Difficulty**: Beginner

**Expected Outcome**: Clear definitions with examples and analysis of when to use each environment type.

## Exercise 4.2: Terrain and Obstacle Modeling
**Objective**: Design a complex simulation environment with varied terrain

**Instructions**: Design a simulation environment for testing humanoid robot navigation that includes at least 3 different types of terrain (e.g., flat ground, stairs, uneven surface) and 3 types of obstacles (e.g., walls, moving objects, narrow passages). Describe the SDF (Simulation Description Format) elements needed to create this environment and explain how each terrain and obstacle type affects robot perception and navigation.

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Expected Outcome**: A detailed environment design with technical implementation details and analysis of robot interactions.

## Exercise 4.3: Environmental Conditions Simulation
**Objective**: Model lighting and environmental conditions for robotics testing

**Instructions**: Describe how to simulate various lighting and environmental conditions in a robotics simulation environment. Include considerations for day/night cycles, weather effects, and how these conditions affect robot sensors (cameras, LiDAR, etc.). Design a test scenario that demonstrates the importance of environmental condition simulation for robot autonomy.

**Difficulty**: Intermediate

**Expected Outcome**: A comprehensive approach to environmental condition simulation with a practical test scenario.

## Exercise 4.4: Repeatability and Determinism in Testing
**Objective**: Ensure repeatability and determinism in simulation environments

**Instructions**: Explain the importance of repeatability and determinism in simulation environments for robotics testing. Design a testing protocol that ensures consistent results across multiple simulation runs. Address potential sources of non-determinism (random number generators, network delays, physics engine variations) and propose solutions to maintain deterministic behavior while still providing realistic testing conditions.

**Difficulty**: Advanced

**Expected Outcome**: A comprehensive testing protocol with solutions for maintaining determinism while preserving realism.
