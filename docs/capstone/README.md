# Mission Briefing: Advanced Humanoid Robot Control System

## Overview
The capstone project integrates all concepts learned throughout the modules into a comprehensive humanoid robot control system. This project demonstrates the complete pipeline from voice commands to physical robot execution.

## Objectives
- Integrate voice recognition with natural language processing
- Connect LLM for high-level task planning
- Implement perception systems for environment understanding
- Develop control algorithms for physical actuation
- Create a cohesive system that responds to natural language commands

## Visual Pipeline
The complete system architecture follows this flow:

```
Voice Input → LLM → Planning → Perception → Control → Actuation
```

### 1. Voice → LLM
- Speech-to-text conversion
- Natural language understanding
- Task interpretation and decomposition

### 2. LLM → Planning
- High-level task planning
- Path planning and obstacle avoidance
- Resource allocation and scheduling

### 3. Planning → Perception
- Sensor data integration
- Environment mapping
- Object detection and recognition
- State estimation

### 4. Perception → Control
- Feedback control loops
- Trajectory generation
- Motion planning
- Safety constraints

### 5. Control → Actuation
- Motor control signals
- Hardware interface
- Real-time execution
- Performance monitoring

## Milestones
1. **Voice Interface**: Implement speech recognition and natural language processing
2. **Task Planning**: Develop LLM integration for task decomposition
3. **Perception System**: Build environment understanding capabilities
4. **Control System**: Implement motion and trajectory control
5. **Integration**: Combine all subsystems into a working prototype
6. **Demo**: Execute complete voice-commanded robot tasks

## Final Demo Expectations
Students will demonstrate their integrated system performing complex tasks commanded through natural language, showcasing the complete pipeline from voice input to physical robot action.

## Prerequisites
Completion of Modules 1-6 is required to attempt the capstone project, as each module provides essential components for the integrated system.
