This is a placeholder for the VLA system architecture diagram.

The diagram should show:
1. Input layer: Voice, text, visual input
2. Cognitive layer: LLM processing and planning
3. Perception layer: Vision and sensor processing
4. Control layer: ROS 2 action execution
5. Integration layer: Coordination and safety mechanisms
6. Data flows between all components
7. Feedback loops for monitoring and adaptation
