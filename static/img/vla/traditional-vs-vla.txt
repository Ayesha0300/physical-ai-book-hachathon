This is a placeholder for the traditional vs VLA robotics comparison diagram.

The diagram should show:
- Left side: Traditional rule-based robotics
  - Pre-programmed behaviors
  - Limited adaptability
  - Explicit scenario programming
  - Rigid control structure

- Right side: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) robotics
  - Natural language interface
  - Visual perception integration
  - Flexible action execution
  - Human-intuitive control

The diagram should highlight the key differences in approach and capabilities between these two paradigms.
