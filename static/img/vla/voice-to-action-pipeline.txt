This is a placeholder for the voice-to-action pipeline diagram.

The diagram should illustrate the flow from:
Audio Input → Speech Recognition → Text Processing → Intent Extraction → Action Mapping → Robot Execution

The pipeline should show:
1. Audio capture from microphones
2. Processing through speech recognition (e.g., OpenAI Whisper)
3. Natural language understanding to extract intent
4. Mapping to robot actions
5. Execution with feedback and safety checks

The diagram should emphasize the real-time nature and potential latency considerations.
