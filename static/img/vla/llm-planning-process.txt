This is a placeholder for the LLM planning process diagram.

The diagram should illustrate:
1. Input: Natural language goal ("Clean the kitchen")
2. LLM Processing: Task decomposition and reasoning
3. Output: Structured plan with subtasks
4. Integration with perception systems
5. Execution on robotic platform

The diagram should show how the LLM serves as the cognitive bridge between high-level goals and low-level robot actions.
