# Digital Twin vs Traditional Simulation Diagrams

## Diagram 1: Conceptual Comparison

### Title: Digital Twin vs Traditional Simulation Architecture

### Description:
This diagram shows the fundamental differences between digital twin and traditional simulation approaches in robotics.

### Elements:
- **Traditional Simulation** (left side):
  - Single simulation environment
  - No connection to physical system
  - One-way process (simulate → analyze)
  - Disconnected from real-world data

- **Digital Twin** (right side):
  - Simulation environment
  - Bidirectional arrows connecting to physical system
  - Real-time data flow
  - Continuous synchronization between virtual and physical

### Key Differences Highlighted:
- Real-time synchronization capability
- Bidirectional data flow
- Continuous learning and refinement
- Predictive capabilities
